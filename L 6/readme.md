# Problem 

Load the digits dataset. Note that the labels are in 10 categories- '0' to '9'. Make it into a 2-class problem using the following - define class-1 to be only images corresponding to digit 'O' and define class-2 to be all digits from '1 to '9'. Now train a GauissianNB classifier to predict. Do 5-fold cross-validation. What is the average error returned by the cross-validation? For which digits are we making the most error in identifying it against '0'?
