# K-Means
Use sklearn.load_digits() to load the digits dataset
Implement the k-means algorithm (from scratch) on this dataset.
1.Use k = 10
2.Pick the initial centersto be uniform at random from all the points
3.Run for 100 iterations

Plot how the objective value decreases with number of iterations
Use imshow() to show the images corresponding to the centersof the clusters
