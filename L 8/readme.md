# Problem

We will use PCA to remove noise in the dataset. Take the digits data by using the load_digits function.

Now add noise to each image by adding a Gaussian noise of variance 1 to every pixel. Now do kmeans clustering and check the accuracy by building the confusion matrix.

Now do PCA and keep only the first two components. Again do clustering and check accuracy by building the confusion matrix.

Submit the output as well as the code
