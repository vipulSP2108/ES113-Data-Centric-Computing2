# Problem

Implement a k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm from scratch. We will first divide the data into test and train. For each point in the test data, we will find out the 5 nearest neighbors from the training data. We will then take the majority of these classes and assign that class to the test data point.

Load the IRIS dataset. Use the above classifier to find the accuracy on the test data. The test data should be 25% of the full data. Report the confusion matrix s well as accuracy.

Please submit both the code as well all the output.
